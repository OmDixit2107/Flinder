# Flinder Flutter App

A modern Flutter application for finding roommates, with integrated real-time chat functionality powered by Supabase.

4. These credentials are already configured in the app at:
   ```
   lib/constants/api_constants.dart
   ```

### 2. Database Schema Setup

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the contents of the `database_schema.sql` file from this project
3. Paste and execute the SQL to create the necessary tables and permissions

   - `chats`
   - `chat_members`
   - `messages`
